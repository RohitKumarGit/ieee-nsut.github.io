                <p class="lead">The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. (IEEE) was born on January 1, 1963, with the merger of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers. If the initial membership of the IEEE was largely comprised of Americans, today the IEEE is spread over 160 countries with more than 350,000 members, spanning a wide spectrum of professional activities, allied to and complementing its original areas of electrical and electronics engineering. With its vision to be essential to the global technical community and to technical professionals everywhere, the IEEE is engaged in the task of fostering technological innovation and excellence.  The reach of IEEE is such that today, there is perhaps no area of human activity, which remains unaffected by it. The IEEE, having grown into the largest technical professional organization in the world, serves its members through a number of platforms like societies, journals, transactions, magazines, conferences and industry standards.</p>

                   <h1 class="display-4"  style="text-align:center;">IEEE INDIA COUNCIL</h1>
            <br>
                  <p class="lead">The IEEE India Council, established in 1973, is one of the five councils in Region 10 (Asia – Pacific) of the IEEE. It coordinates the activities of the IEEE in India, carried out through the various sections and chapters. With a membership of about 48,500, the IEEE India Council is one of the most active in Region 10, with the top five positions being occupied by India Council Sections. The IEEE India Council has been very successful in motivating the student community to take part in IEEE activities, as is evident with the large number of student members.</p>

                   <h1 class="display-4"  style="text-align:center;">IEEE DELHI SECTION</h1>
            <br>
                  <p class="lead">IEEE Delhi Section is one of the vibrant Sections in India coming under Asia-Pacific Region, the Region 10 of IEEE. It covers entire northern part of the country consisting of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, Union Territory of Chandigarh and the five states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. IEEE Delhi Section, which started on May 13, 1976 (after remaining as Sub-section since 1974), has as per January 2013 statistics (excluding Affiliates to Societies) 5208 active members including 3461 student members from over 80 member colleges, a number that is increasing with rapid pace by the day. IEEE Delhi follows standard IEEE and Section bylaws while operating.
            </p><br>
                   <p class="lead">It has got a Subsection at Chandigarh and thirteen society/council chapters along with three affinity groups. IEEE Delhi Section alone or with the support of these chapters and the local units of other societies like, IET (UK), IETE, IE (India), etc. organize from time to time activities for dissemination of knowledge in the broader fields of Electrical and Electronics Engineering through holding of technical talk, seminar, conference, symposium, workshop, tutorial, etc. Not only this, IEEE Delhi events also promote exchange of ideas and sharing of knowledge amongst the professionals in the corresponding fields. As a society, it has always focused on giving the student members services that justify the membership fee by opening new avenues and providing exciting, yet equal opportunities for one and all.
            </p><br>
                   <p class="lead">Fests and events organized by various college chapters have a plethora of competitions incorporating both the technical and non-technical aspect of engineering.
            </p><br>
                   <p class="lead">IEEE Delhi has always kept to its promise of continuously expanding its horizons. With a new academic session set to begin in August, IEEE Delhi will have many events organized in various institutions. With new students joining college and IEEE, the ‘family’ is certain to grow. IEEE Delhi’s belief in imparting technical as well as non-technical knowledge will be carried forward with an equivalent enthusiasm and gusto for a long long time to come.
