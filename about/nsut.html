            <br> <p class="lead">NSUT ( formerly known as NSIT) is regarded as one of the premier engineering institutions in India. It traces back a glorious history of nurturing some of the finest minds in the country. Apart from being instrumental in providing quality education and research in various areas of the technical field, it also hosts a  spectrum of established companies for its internship and placement drives. NSUT believes in building strong cultural roots among the students and strives to provide a balanced environment for their growth. </p>

            <br><p class="lead">The journey of NSUT would be incomplete without the mention of DIT. Delhi Institute of Technology (DIT) was established in July 1983 by the Delhi Government with approval from the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Govt. of India, to fulfil the persistent and ever-growing demand of manpower in the field of technology. From 1983 till 1998, the Institute was operating from its old campus at the old I.G. Block, Kashmere Gate, Delhi - 110006. The Institute was formally inaugurated in its own new campus in Dwarka, New Delhi, on 23rd January, 1997 by Sh. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of India. The Institute was renamed as 'Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology' (NSIT) in the year 1997 and has now been upgraded as 'Netaji Subhas University of Technology' (NSUT) in the year 2018. Commencing with a single undergraduate program in the field of Electronics & Communication Engineering under the Faculty of Technology, University of Delhi, NSUT has come a long way by introducing a number of engineering programs in the fields of Computers, Instrumentation & Control, Manufacturing Processes & Automation,  Information Technology, Biotechnology and Mechanical Engineering. After acquiring the status of a university, it is at the threshold of providing exhaustive learning in the disciplines of Applied Sciences & Mathematics, Humanities & Social Sciences and Management.
