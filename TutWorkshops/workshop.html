<p>Containerization has received a wide attention from various companies as a way for next generation application development, deployment and management. This concept has been popularized by the open source initiative – dockers. Today’s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, data centers and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation. The workshop will also expose an overview of kubernetes and how it can help scale the application you developed to a large scale.</p>
<p>Experiments to be carried out during the workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup docker in their laptop</li>
<li>Create a docker ID</li>
<li>Pull existing image from Docker hub</li>
<li>Create a new web application as a docker image and push it to docker repository</li>
<li>Learn the basics of Kubernetes for scaling the applications</li>
</ul>

<p>Unix (UNICS) is a feature rich and robust operating system. UNIX and most of its Variants are used in high end server environment. The kernel is unique and Subsystems are really well built. Most of the modern day operating systems are based on Unix/Linux kernel which conveys how important it is to learn and Understand UNIX.</p>
<p>UNIX has a very rich set of system calls and also supports vast range of commands thus making it very versatile. Building an application through the C Programming Language with proper system calls should be understood by any application developer. The book proposed is intended to elaborate both theoretically and practically (through program codes) the following (But, not limited to)</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals - A recap of essential UNIX commands and Shell.</li>
<li>File system and file system architecture.</li>
<li>Files and Processes.</li>
<li>Process tracking and scheduling.</li>
<li>Memory Management</li>
<li>Signals and Signal programming.</li>
<li>Timers in UNIX.</li>
<li>Interprocess Communication</li>
<li>Daemon Processes</li>
<li>File Locking concepts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tutorial will provide the essential knowledge and skills of UNIX system programming and the topics are also compatible with Linux, Solaris and HP-UX. All the explanation and demos shall be based on UBUNTU Kernel.&nbsp; Real time demos for all the concepts shall be presented to the participants.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Shriram K. Vasudevan</strong> is an M. Tech., MBA, Ph. D. with over 12 years of industrial and academic experience. He received his Master’s degree and Doctorate in the field of Embedded Systems. He has worked with major multinational companies like Wipro and Aricent Technologies; and been to USA on a technical assignment while functioning for WIPRO technologies. Presently, he is employed at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham and serves as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He has authored/co-authored 32 books in various fields and is currently authoring 3 more. He has published more than 100 international papers in various international journals and conferences.</p>
