<p>The IEEE India Council, the IEEE Madras Section and the Organising Committee of INDICON 2018 call on researchers in India and abroad, to present their original work at INDICON 2018, to be conducted during December 16 â€“ 18, 2018, at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore. With Harnessing Technology for Humanity as its theme, INDICON 2018 aims to foster interaction between industry and academia and covers research, development and applications in the areas of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering.</p>
<br><p>INDICON2018 has been organized into twelve tracks, with various topics under each. The details of the different tracks and the topics can be obtained from elsewhere on this website. All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous peer-review process and authors of selected papers will be invited to present their work at INDICON 2018, after registration. Only such papers will be published in the Proceedings of the Conference. Over the years, the proceedings of INDICON have set standards for the quality as well as the nature of the work presented. The Conference Proceedings have been included in IEEExplore as well as indexed by important indexing services like SCOPUS. The Proceedings of INDICON2018 will be submitted to IEEE for possible inclusion in IEEExplore, after the papers undergo a further round of reviews, at the discretion of IEEE. The detailed pdf version of the Call for Papers (CfP) may be downloaded from <a href="Assets/cfp_details.jpeg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
